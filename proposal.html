        <li><h4>High Concept:</h4>Simplified Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon with a fantasy theme. </li>
        <li><h4>Genre:</h4> Top-Down Dungeon Crawler.</li>
        <li><h4>Platform:</h4> Desktop and mobile-friendly.</li>
        <li><h4>Story:</h4> Your character progresses deeper into a dungeon in search of wealth and glory.<br><br>

            A tense mood hangs over the game, since you can't see very far ahead of you.
            Anything could be lurking just out of sight. <br><br>

            The player explores a floor of the dungeon until they find the stairway to descend further.<br><br>
            Upon reaching the bottom floor, the player faces a boss monster and either wins or loses.<br><br>

            The player can seek out items hidden in the dungeon to improve their abilities in combat. The player can try to finish the game as fast as
            possible.</li>
        <li><h4>Aesthetics:</h4> 
            <h5>Graphics:</h5>
            Simple, minimalist graphical style.
        <h5>Graphics:</h5>
            Sound effects for dealing / receiving damage, finding an item, losing or winning the game.<br>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Gameplay: </h4> 
            <h5>Mechanics: </h5>
            The dungeon is based on a square tile system.<br>
            The player can move to an adjacent tile in any of the four cardinal directions, if there is a tile to move to. <br>
            The player can move onto a tile containing an item to pick it up.<br>
            The player can move onto a tile occupied by an enemy to battle it.<br>
            Combat occurs automatically.<br>
            The player can click an onscreen button to swap their equipped item. This can make combat easier or 
            harder depending on the opponent.<br>
        <h5>Controls: </h5> 
            Keyboard and mouse for desktop. (WASD)<br>
            Touch with onscreen buttons for mobile.
        <h5>Teaching the Game: </h5> The first floor of the dungeon is largely linear. It teaches             movement, item collecting, combat, and descending to further floors, one at a time. Some tips are displayed on the start screen as well.
        <h5>Player Learning: </h5> 
            To play the game, the player must learn to move, pick up items, and attack enemies.<br>
            Beating the game requires some strategy to find the best items to use against different enemies.<br>
            To get a fast time, the player will need to be able to do all of this quickly and efficiently.<br><br>

            For example, the player must defeat a fire knight to proceed. They could attack  with their current item, a regular sword, but they would have much greater success by exploring a side path to find the Ice Staff. This item deals much more damage to the fire knight, and allows the player to avoid taking damage entirely.</li>
        <li><h4>Screenshots:</h4>   <img src="media/Mockup1.jpg" alt="Screenshot 1"><br> Here the player is visible near the bottom, and an enemy knight is visible near the top.<br>
         <img src="media/Mockup2.jpg" alt="Screenshot 2"><br>   Here the player is standing adjacent to an item, the Ice Staff.
</li>
        <li><h4>Other: </h4> The game exists in a square frame to add to the claustrophobic mood, and to improve compatibility with mobile devices playing in portrait mode.</li>
        <li><h4>About the Developer: </h4>

            I like programming and love game design. Aligning code with the strange workings of the human brain to
            create a compelling experience has always fascinated me. </li>
